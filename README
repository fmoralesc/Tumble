Tumble for vim
==============

This script adds to vim the ability to send text entries to the tumblr.com blogging platform. It supports markdown formatting, and detects titles. It can also rewrite old entries.

The original version was based on Travis Jeffery's tumblr.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2329).
