*tumble.txt* A tumblr plugin for vim

Author: Felipe Morales <hel.sheep@gmail.com>

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

INTRODUCTION                                          *tumble-introduction* 

This script adds to vim the ability to send text entries to the tumblr.com
blogging platform. It supports markdown formatting, and is able to edit and 
delete previous entries.

COMMANDS                                              *tumble-commands*

tumble.vim adds the following commands to Vim: 

:[range]Tumble [draft|published]                      *:Tumble*
		By default, it posts the entire current buffer to tumblr.com,
		but a range can be supplied if that isn't desired. For
		example, ":,Tumble" would post the current selection.

		Unless 'draft' (sans ') is given as an argument, it publishes
		the post immediately. The default behaviour is equivalent to
		":Tumble published". Any other argument could make the posting
		to fail. tumble.vim doesn't have safety measures against that
		currently.

		Whenever it can, tumble.vim tries to be smart. If it finds a
		first level setext style markdown title in the first lines of
		the buffer or range, it detects it as a title. If the title is
		found to be the same as the one from an earlier post, it
		overwrites it, instead of sending a new post.

:[range]TumbleLink                                    *:TumbleLink*
		It assumes the [range] is formatted thus:

			URL
			NAME
			DESCRIPTION

		NAME and DESCRIPTION are optional, but NAME should always be
		on line 2 (so if you don't want to give a name to the link,
		you should keep this line blank).

:TumblesList [draft|published]                        *:TumblesList*
		It prints a list of your published or drafting posts in the
		current buffer. If you press <enter> over a post line,
		tumble.vim will try to fetch the post and load it for editing.
		If you press <delete>, it will delete the post.

OPTIONS                                               *tumble-options*

Tumble requires a number of variables to be set in order to work.  They are
evaluated on every command, so you can change them on the fly in case you need
to switch to another blog.  All variables are required, except for
|g:tumblr_http_proxy| which is only necessary if you use a proxy to access
HTTP.

g:tumblr_email                                        *g:tumblr_email*
		The email address of the account you want to post to.

g:tumblr_password                                     *g:tumblr_password*
		The password of the account you want to post to.
g:tumblr_tumblelog                                    *g:tumblr_tumblelog*
		The full URL of the account you want to post to, without the
		http:// prefix, for example "accountname.tumblr.com"

g:tumblr_http_proxy                                   *g:tumblr_http_proxy*
		Use this parameter if you access HTTP through a proxy

ABOUT                                                 *tumble-about*

The original version was based on Travis Jeffery's tumblr.vim
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2329), and the current version
contains some ideas from it.
