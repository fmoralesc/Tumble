Tumble for vim
==============

This script adds to vim the ability to send text entries to the tumblr.com
blogging platform. It supports markdown formatting, and is able to edit
previous entries. 

tumble.vim adds only one command to Vim: 
	
	:Tumble

the syntax for it is
	
	:[range]Tumble [draft|publish]

By default, it posts the entire current buffer to tumblr.com, but a range can
be supplied if that isn't desired. For example, ":,Tumble" would post the
current selection.

Unless 'draft' (sans ') is given as an argument, it publishes the post
immediately. The default behaviour is equivalent to ":Tumble publish". Any
other argument could make the posting to fail. tumble.vim doesn't have safety
measures against that currently.

Whenever it can, tumble.vim tries to be smart. If it finds a first level setext
style markdown title in the first lines of the buffer or range, it detects it
as a title. If the title is found to be the same as the one from an earlier
post, it overwrites it, instead of sending a new post.

The original version was based on Travis Jeffery's tumblr.vim
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2329), and the current version
contains some ideas from it.
