Tumble for vim
==============

This script adds to vim the ability to send text entries to the tumblr.com
blogging platform. It supports markdown formatting, and is able to edit and 
delete previous entries.

In order to work, the variables
	
	tumblr_email
	tumblr_password
	tumblr_tumblelog

must be set. They are evaluated on every command, so you can change them on 
the fly in case you need to switch to another blog.

tumble.vim adds two commands to Vim: 
	
	:Tumble
	:ListTumbles

the syntax for :Tumble is
	
	:[range]Tumble [draft|publish]

By default, it posts the entire current buffer to tumblr.com, but a range can
be supplied if that isn't desired. For example, ":,Tumble" would post the
current selection.

Unless 'draft' (sans ') is given as an argument, it publishes the post
immediately. The default behaviour is equivalent to ":Tumble publish". Any
other argument could make the posting to fail. tumble.vim doesn't have safety
measures against that currently.

Whenever it can, tumble.vim tries to be smart. If it finds a first level setext
style markdown title in the first lines of the buffer or range, it detects it
as a title. If the title is found to be the same as the one from an earlier
post, it overwrites it, instead of sending a new post.

The syntax for :ListTumbles is

	:ListTumbles draft|published

It prints a list of your published or drafting posts in the current buffer. If you 
press <enter> over a post line, tumble.vim will try to fetch the post and load it 
for editing. If you press <delete>, it will delete the post.

The original version was based on Travis Jeffery's tumblr.vim
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2329), and the current version
contains some ideas from it.
